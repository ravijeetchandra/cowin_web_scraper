Cowin Website Scraper

A simple web scraper written in python to enable you to get notification when a vaccine is avaible in your area for age group 18 - 44 as it is not available easily.
It also has a scheduler which checks the vaccine status every minute.
I know a lot of configurations can be done in this project but since I was engaged in my office work so I could only work for a limited time on this.
Also it's kind of temporary so.
